<!-- description: Write copy for an in-product onboarding flow or empty state sequence -->
You are a UX writer. Write onboarding copy for the following:

- **Product**: {{product}}
- **User type**: {{user_type}}
- **Goal of onboarding**: {{onboarding_goal}}
- **Number of steps**: {{step_count}}
- **Tone**: {{tone}}

{{#if key_actions}}
Key actions the user needs to complete: {{key_actions}}
{{/if}}

For each onboarding step provide:

1. **Step title** — short, action-oriented
2. **Body copy** — 1-2 sentences max. What does the user need to know right now?
3. **Primary CTA** — the next action
4. **Skip / later option** (if applicable)
5. **Progress indicator text** — e.g. "Step 2 of 4" or equivalent

Then provide:

- **Welcome message** — the very first thing a new user sees after signing up (heading + 1 sentence)
- **Completion message** — what they see when onboarding is done (celebratory but not cringe)

Principles to follow:
- Each step should have one job — don't overload the user
- Tell users what they'll get, not just what to do
- Reduce anxiety — reassure users they can change things later
- Momentum matters — make each step feel quick and achievable

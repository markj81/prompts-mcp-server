Produce a structured synthesis with:

1. **Key themes** — 3-5 themes that emerged across participants, each with:
   - A clear theme title
   - A one-sentence summary
   - Supporting evidence (paraphrased quotes or observations, not verbatim)
   - How many participants this affected

2. **Key insights** — the "so what" behind the themes. What do these patterns mean for the product or team?

3. **Opportunities** — 2-4 actionable opportunities or design directions suggested by the findings

4. **Open questions** — what remains unanswered that warrants further research?

Write in plain, direct language. Avoid jargon. Separate observation from interpretation clearly.

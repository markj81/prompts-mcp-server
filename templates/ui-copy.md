<!-- description: Write UI microcopy for buttons, errors, empty states, tooltips and onboarding -->
You are a UX writer. Write UI copy for the following:

- **Product**: {{product}}
- **Component type**: {{component_type}}
- **Context**: {{context}}
- **User's goal at this moment**: {{user_goal}}
- **Tone of voice**: {{tone}}

{{#if constraints}}
Constraints (character limits, platform rules, etc.): {{constraints}}
{{/if}}

Provide 3 copy variants for each of the following (where applicable to the component type):

- **Heading / title**
- **Body text or description**
- **Primary action label**
- **Secondary action or dismiss label**
- **Error state** (what went wrong + what to do)
- **Empty state** (no data yet — encourage action)
- **Success state** (confirmation message)

For each variant note: the emotional tone it conveys and when you'd use it.

Guidelines:
- Lead with action verbs on buttons
- Error messages should explain what happened and what to do next — never blame the user
- Empty states should be encouraging, not just "No results found"
- Keep it conversational but not cutesy
- Avoid passive voice

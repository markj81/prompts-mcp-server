<!-- description: Generate a user research discussion guide for interviews -->
You are an experienced UX researcher. Create a discussion guide for a user research interview with the following details:

- **Research goal**: {{research_goal}}
- **Participant type**: {{participant_type}}
- **Session length**: {{session_length}} minutes
- **Product or feature being researched**: {{product_or_feature}}

{{#if context}}
Additional context: {{context}}
{{/if}}

The discussion guide should include:

1. **Introduction** (2-3 minutes) — welcome, purpose, consent, recording notice
2. **Warm-up questions** — 2-3 questions to build rapport and understand the participant's background
3. **Main topics** — 4-6 open-ended questions or prompts organised by theme, with follow-up probes for each
4. **Task or scenario** (if applicable) — a realistic scenario to ground the conversation
5. **Closing** — opportunity for participant to add anything, thank you, next steps

Use open-ended, non-leading questions. Avoid yes/no questions. Note which sections are time-boxed.

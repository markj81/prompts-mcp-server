Produce a findings report with:

1. **Executive summary** — 3-4 sentences covering the headline findings and overall usability picture

2. **Issues by severity** — list issues found, grouped as:
   - 🔴 Critical — blocked task completion or caused significant confusion
   - 🟡 Moderate — caused friction or hesitation but participant recovered
   - 🟢 Minor — small polish issues or points of confusion that didn't derail the task

   For each issue include: what happened, how many participants were affected, and a suggested direction for fixing it.

3. **What worked well** — 2-4 things participants found clear, intuitive, or positive

4. **Recommended next steps** — prioritised list of actions for the team

Keep language factual and evidence-based. Reference participant count where relevant (e.g. "3 of 5 participants...").

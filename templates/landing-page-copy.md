<!-- description: Write conversion-focused landing page copy -->
You are a conversion copywriter. Write landing page copy for the following:

- **Product or service**: {{product_or_service}}
- **Target audience**: {{audience}}
- **Primary value proposition**: {{value_proposition}}
- **Primary CTA**: {{cta}}
- **Tone**: {{tone}}

{{#if pain_points}}
Key pain points to address: {{pain_points}}
{{/if}}

{{#if social_proof}}
Social proof available: {{social_proof}}
{{/if}}

Write copy for the following sections:

1. **Hero** — headline (8 words max), subheadline (1-2 sentences), CTA button text
2. **Problem** — 2-3 sentences naming the pain the audience feels
3. **Solution** — how the product solves it, in plain language
4. **Key benefits** — 3 benefit statements (lead with the outcome, not the feature)
5. **Social proof** — a short testimonial or credibility statement
6. **FAQ** — 3 common objections answered briefly
7. **Closing CTA** — a final push with urgency or reassurance

Write for clarity first, persuasion second. Avoid superlatives. Be specific — numbers and concrete details outperform vague claims.
